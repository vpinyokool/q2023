					I think we've only had like three chats back when I was at
					Pinterest! We talked about those crazy expensive Common
					Project sneakers, geeked out over Lego design, and had a
					good laugh about how my memoji is basically my twin! You
					briefly mentioned your cool idea, and I've put together a
					few projects I had a hand in during my time at Pinterest.

					If you want to see more or have any questions about them,
					just give me a shout. Pardon the rough edges of this site.
